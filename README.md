# WindowsUpdateTotalReset
This script completely and aggressively resets Windows update and related components.
It is particularly useful on older installs where updates completely fail to even check properly let alone download and install.

Using this script can be potentially dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, run it at your own risk.
Absolutely no support will be given in a case where you damage a Windows install.
